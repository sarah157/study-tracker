# Study Session Tracker with Pomodoro Timer

Term Project for UBC CPSC 210 course (Winter 2022)

## Introduction
This application keeps track of your study or focus sessions with the help of a customizable *pomodoro* timer. 
You may add a session that you have already completed or start a new session with the pomodoro timer. 
The timer follows the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which works by alternating 
between pomodoros (work intervals) and rest intervals. A cycle typically consists of four 25-minute pomodoros separated 
by 5-minute short breaks. After each cycle, take a longer 25-minute break then repeat! The number of pomodoro repeats 
and interval durations may be customized in this app.

If you're looking to improve the consistency and efficiency of your study sessions, tracking your sessions and/or using 
a pomodoro timer may be helpful. This app can be used for any routine or long-term activity that requires 
focus and attention such as studying for a course or reading a book in your spare time.

The Pomodoro technique has greatly improved the efficiency of my study sessions. I thought it would be interesting and 
motivating to keep track of these sessions to see how they vary depending on the time, day of the week and other factors.
With this application, I can quickly start a pomodoro timer and track a study session all in one go.
